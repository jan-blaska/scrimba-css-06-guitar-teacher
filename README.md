#### Learn how to make websites responsive - project 2.
#### This was originally Product Splash Page and then it was transformed into the site of guitar teacher.

#### What I have used:
 1. change the case of text
 2. viewport units
 3. flexbox order
 4. box-sizing
 5. style form elements, modifiers and more
